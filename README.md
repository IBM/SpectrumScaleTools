**ece_tuned_profile**

  Tuned profile to be used on IBM Spectrum Scale Erasure Code Edition (ECE)
  
**ece_os_readiness**

  Assesses the readiness of a single node to run IBM Spectrum Scale Erasure Code Edition (ECE).
  
**ece_os_overview**

  Uses the JSON files from ece_os_readiness to summarize the all servers readiness.
  
**ece_network_readiness**

  Runs a network test across multiple nodes and compare the results against IBM Spectrum Scale Key Performance Indicators (KPI). This tool attempts to hide much of the complexity of running network measurement tools, and present the results in an easy to interpret way.
  
**ece_storage_readiness**

  Runs a raw read test on storage using FIO tool and presenting the results against IBM Storage Scale Key Performance Indicators (KPI). This tool attempts to hide much of the complexity of running network measurement tools, and present the results in an easy to interpret way.
  
**ece_capacity_estimator**

  Calculates the effective capacity of Storage Scale Native RAID systems. It is an estimation and actual figures could differ from the calculated ones. Be prepared for 1% deviations when using this tool.
